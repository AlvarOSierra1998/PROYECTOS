                    <p>From this point he marched two stages—ten parasangs—to the river Psarus, which is two hundred
                        feet broad, and from the Psarus he marched a single stage—five parasangs—to Issi, the last city
                        in Cilicia. It lies on the seaboard—a prosperous, large and flourishing town. Here they halted
                        three days, and here Cyrus was joined by his fleet. There were thirty-five ships from
                        Peloponnesus, with the Lacedaemonian admiral Pythagoras on board. These had been piloted from
                        Ephesus by Tamos the Egyptian, who himself had another fleet of twenty-five ships belonging to
                        Cyrus. These had formed Tamos's blockading squadron at Miletus, when that city sided with
                        Tissaphernes; he had also used them in other military services rendered to Cyrus in his
                        operations against that satrap. There was a third officer on board the fleet, the Lacedaemonian
                        Cheirisophus, who had been sent for by Cyrus, and had brought with him seven hundred hoplites,
                        over whom he was to act as general in the service of Cyrus. The fleet lay at anchor opposite
                        Cyrus's tent. Here too another reinforcement presented itself. This was a body of four hundred
                        hoplites, Hellenic mercenaries in the service of Abrocomas, who deserted him for Cyrus, and
                        joined in the campaign against the king.</p>
                    <p>From This, he marched a single stage—five parasangs—to the gates of Cilicia and Syria. This was a
                        double fortress: the inner and nearer one, which protects Cilicia, was held by Syennesis and a
                        garrison of Cilicians; the outer and further one, protecting Syria, was reported to be
                        garrisoned by a body of the king's troops. Through the gap between the two fortresses flows a
                        river named the Carsus, which is a hundred feet broad, and the whole space between was scarcely
                        more than six hundred yards. To force a passage here would be impossible, so narrow was the pass
                        itself, with the fortification walls stretching down to the sea, and precipitous rocks above;
                        while both fortresses were furnished with gates. It was the existence of this pass which had
                        induced Cyrus to send for the fleet, so as to enable him to lead a body of hoplites inside and
                        outside the gates; and so to force a passage through the enemy, if he were guarding the Syrian
                        gate, as he fully expected to find Abrocomas doing with a large army. This, however, Abrocomas
                        had not done; but as soon as he learnt that Cyrus was in Cilicia, he had turned round and made
                        his exit from Phoenicia, to join the king with an army amounting, as report said, to three
                        hundred thousand men.</p>
                    <p>From this point Cyrus pursued his march, through Syria a single stage—five parasangs—to
                        Myriandus, a city inhabited by Phoenicians, on the sea-coast. This was a commercial port, and
                        numerous merchant vessels were riding at anchor in the harbour. Here they halted seven days, and
                        here Xenias the Arcadian general, and Pasion the Megarian got on board a trader, and having
                        stowed away their most valuable effects, set sail for home; most people explained the act as the
                        outcome of a fit of jealousy, because Cyrus had allowed Clearchus to retain their men, who had
                        deserted to him, in hopes of returning to Hellas instead of marching against the king; when the
                        two had so vanished, a rumour spread that Cyrus was after them with some ships of war, and some
                        hoped the cowards might be caught, others pitied them, if that should be their fate.</p>
